This application requires python, which is included on any linux machine. If the local system you are using does not have python make sure to obtain it.

Also, to get all the requirements installed we have included a piprequirements.txt file that will install the libraries needed using pip. Install pip via http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html.

Once python and pip are installed make sure you also have git. Then clone this repository "git clone git@github.com:FIU-SCIS-Senior-Project-2015-Spring/SaaS-Integration-Library.git". 

After obtaining the repository navigate to /SaaS-Integration-Library/Code/Website/SaaS_Integration_Library and then run "sudo pip install -r piprequirements.txt". You now have all the required libraries!
